            We all do the same form of analysis. We all see the same charts. There are none of us who possesses special insider information, which will give us an edge. It means we are all in the same boat.

        <p>
            In my way thinking, I am reasoning, that if everyone reads the same books, do the same form of analysis, work on the same form of trade execution and profit taking, then is there really space for all of us to profit?
            I trade in my system, and I always respect my system
